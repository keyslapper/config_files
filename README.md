Mostly this is my general use config dump.  I keep losing the darn things and
having to rebuild them.  Now I won't have to start from scratch, and I can just
keep improving things.

Most of the stuff here came from other people's configs, either at work,
online, or in various tutorial pages sprinkled around the net.  I claim no
ownership, and have no problem with anyone using anything in here.

Some file checks are conspicuously not satisfied, like the .workrc checks.
Those are for environment specific configurations I should avoid publicizing
for security reasons.  Not to mention I just don't want these bits in my
personal configs.
